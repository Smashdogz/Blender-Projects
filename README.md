# Blender-Projects
A collection of the various Projects made in Blender from my time in BIFE.
unfortunatley due to the file size limit I have to provide a link to my google drive that contains the games

The games displayed here are Asteroid Defense Force: this was the first game I ever created back in 2014
I created all the models and textures, it is an asteroid defense game similir to space invaders and gives
the player the option to switch between top down and first person mode

The second game is Wind up Destruction is a game heavily inspired smy Smashy City where the player
controls a robot and has the objective of destroying all of the buildings in the level

Both of these were made in Blenders game engine which it no longer has
